        <p>An algebraic equation is a polynomial equation where the unknown variable \(x\) is raised to a non-negative integer power and the coefficients are constants.</p>
        <p>For example, the equation \(x^2 - x + 6 = 0\) is an algebraic equation that can be solved using various methods.</p>
        <p>A transcendental equation involves functions such as trigonometric, logarithmic, or exponential and cannot be expressed in a specific known form. Therefore, solving transcendental equations is more challenging than solving algebraic equations. </p>
        <p>For example, the equation \(x = tan(x)\) is a transcendental equation.</p>
        <p>There are no general formulas to find the solution of higher degree algebraic and transcendental equations, and numerical methods are usually used to find the solution.</p>

        <p>In many cases, these equations have no closed-form solutions, and numerical methods must be used to find approximations of the solutions.</p>
        <p>Root-finding algorithms provide a way to find these approximations quickly and accurately.</p>

        <h4>Root Finding Process</h4>
        <p>The process of finding the roots of an equation of the form for a given function \(f\) is known as root-finding or root-solving.</p>
        <p>A root of the equation is also called a zero of the function \(f\).</p>
        \[
                f(x) = 0
        \]
        For this process, we will encounter two types of numerical methods.
        <h5>Direct methods</h5>
        <p>Methods that find the exact solution to a problem using a finite number of operations.</p>
        <h5>Iterative method</h5>
        <p>A mathematical procedure that generates a sequence of approximations to a desired solution by repeatedly applying a fixed rule. It starts with an initial approximation and then generates a new approximation in each iteration, using the result of the previous one. </p>
        <p>The iterative method stops when a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a certain level of accuracy or a maximum number of iterations.</p>
