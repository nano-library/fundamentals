            A computer does not keep real numbers in their full mathematical form. 
            Instead, it records a structured approximation made of three parts: 
            a <em>sign</em>, a finite sequence of <em>digits</em>, and an <em>exponent</em>.
        </p>

        <h4>The general form (base \(\beta\) )</h4>

        <p>
            Using base \(\beta\), any non-zero number \(x\) in a floating-point system is written as
        </p>

        \[
            x = s \cdot (.a_1a_2\ldots a_t )_\beta \cdot \beta^{\,e}
        \]
        \[
            x = (\text{sign})\cdot(\text{fractional part})\cdot(\text{exponent})
        \]

        <p>where the pieces follow these rules:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>\(s = -1\) or \(s = +1\)</li>
            <li>\(0 \le a_i \le \beta - 1\)</li>
            <li>\(L \le e \le U\), with \(e\) an integer and typically \(L&lt;0&lt;U\)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What does the “fractional part” mean?</h3>

        <p>
            The string \((.a_1a_2\ldots a_t)_\beta\) is just shorthand for a finite base-\(\beta\) expansion:
        </p>

        \[
            (.a_1a_2\ldots a_t)_\beta
            = \frac{a_1}{\beta} + \frac{a_2}{\beta^2} + \cdots + \frac{a_t}{\beta^t}
        \]

        <h3>Normalization</h3>
        <p>
            We usually assume \(a_1 \ne 0\). That condition is called a normalized floating-point system.
            The normalization condition ensures uniqueness of representation by preventing 
            more than one digit sequence from corresponding to the same number, 
            such as those obtained by introducing leading zeros in the fractional part.
        </p>

        <h3>How we name a floating-point system</h3>

        <p>The parameters \((\beta, t, L, U)\) specify the arithmetic characteristics of the floating-point system:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>\(\beta\): base</li>
            <li>\(t\): number of digits kept in the fractional part (precision)</li>
            <li>\(L, U\): smallest and largest allowed exponents (range)</li>
        </ul>

        <p> In such a system, a floating-point number is determined by the tuple \(\{s, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_t, e\}\). </p>

        <p>On modern computers, the base \(\beta = 2\), i.e., we use the binary number system. There are only two digits, \({0, 1}\), which can be easily represented in computer hardware</p>

        <h4>Two unavoidable consequences</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
            <strong>Not every real number can be represented.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>So there are <em>gaps</em> in \(F\).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Very small and very large numbers can't be represented.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Because the exponent is trapped between \(L\) and \(U\).</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>In spite of these limitations, modern computers have enough precision in representing real numbers which allows us to obtain useful numerical answers to mathematical equations modeling nature.</p>
