            Numerical Methods is a foundational course that bridges mathematical theory and computational practice, equipping students with systematic techniques for solving problems that resist exact analytical solutions. 
            The course develops rigorous approaches to approximating solutions of non-linear and transcendental equations, analyzing convergence behavior and error propagation, and evaluating the strengths and limitations of competing algorithms. 
            To explore direct and iterative methods for linear systems, investigate ill-conditioning and sensitivity, and compute dominant eigenvalues using numerical strategies. 
            The curriculum extends to interpolation, numerical integration through Newton-Cotes and quadrature formulas, and the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations using both single-step and multi-step schemes, including boundary value problems treated via shooting and finite difference methods. 
            Emphasis is placed on algorithmic thinking and computational implementation, with MATLAB used as a practical tool for translating mathematical concepts into efficient, reliable numerical solutions.
