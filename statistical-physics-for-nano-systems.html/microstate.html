        <p>At the molecular level, however, a large number of possibilities still exist because at that level there will in general be a large number of different ways in which the macrostate \((N, V , E)\) of the given system can be realized</p>
        <p> In the case of a non-interacting system, since the total energy \(E\) consists of a simple sum of the N single-particle energies \(\varepsilon_i\), there will obviously be a large number of different ways in which the individual \(\varepsilon_i\) can be chosen so as to make the total energy equal to \(E\). </p>
        <p>In other words, there will be a large number of different ways in which the total energy \(E\) of the system can be distributed among the \(N\) particles constituting it. Each of these (different) ways specifies a <strong>microstate</strong>, or complexion, of the given system.</p>
