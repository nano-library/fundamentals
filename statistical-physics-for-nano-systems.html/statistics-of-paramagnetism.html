        <p>we study a system of \(N\) magnetic dipoles, each having a magnetic moment \(\mu\). In the presence of an external magnetic field \(H\), the dipoles will experience a torque tending to align them in the direction of the field.</p>
        <p>If there were nothing else to check this tendency, the dipoles would align themselves precisely in this direction and we would achieve a complete magnetization of the system. </p>

        <p>The model adopted for this study consists of N identical, localized (and, hence, distinguishable), practically static, mutually noninteracting and freely orientable dipoles. We consider first the case of classical dipoles that can be oriented in any direction relative to the applied magnetic field. It is obvious that the only energy we need to consider here is the potential energy of the dipoles that arises from the presence of the external field H and is determined by the orientations of the dipoles with respect to the direction of the field:</p>
